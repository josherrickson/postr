# Post estimation for GLMs in R

After fitting a logistic model in R using `glm`, getting classification
rates, ROC curves and AUCs are non-trivial - theyâ€™re easy to do, but
require coding manually every time.

The `postr` package simplifies this.

    data(mtcars)
    m <- glm(vs ~ gear + mpg, data = mtcars, family = binomial)

All functions are prefaced by `postr_` (aliased with `pr_`) to simplify
the names without worrying about conflicts with other packages. For
example,

    postr_classificationtable(m, threshold = .4)
    #>         Classified
    #> Observed  0  1
    #>        0 13  5
    #>        1  3 11
    pr_sensitivity(m, threshold = .4)
    #> [1] 0.7857143
    pr_AUC(m)
    #> [1] 0.9246032

    pr_ROC(m)
